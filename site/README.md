## Adding New Games

### Method 1: Simple Addition
1. Create a new folder in the `games/` directory (e.g., `games/my-awesome-game/`)
2. Add your game's main HTML file to that folder (can be `index.html`, `game.html`, `play.html`, etc.)
3. Add the game info to `games.json` with the correct path

### Method 2: With Custom Info
1. Create your game folder as above
2. Add a `game-info.json` file with the following structure:

```json
{
  "title": "My Awesome Game",
  "description": "An incredibly fun game that will keep you entertained for hours!",
  "icon": "🚀",
  "author": "Your Name",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "controls": {
    "mouse": "Click to interact",
    "keyboard": "Arrow keys to move"
  },
  "features": [
    "High scores",
    "Multiple levels",
    "Sound effects"
  ]
}
```

### Method 3: Direct Configuration
Edit `games.json` in the root to add games:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "my-game",
    "title": "My Game",
    "description": "Game description",
    "icon": "🎯",
    "path": "games/my-game/game.html"
  }
]
```

## Game Development Guidelines

### Required Files
- Main HTML file (can be named anything: `index.html`, `game.html`, `play.html`, `main.html`, etc.)
- Entry in `games.json` with correct path to your main HTML file

### Recommended Structure
```
your-game/
├── game.html       # Main game file (or index.html, play.html, etc.)
├── style.css       # Game styles
├── script.js       # Game logic
├── cover.jpg       # Cover image (920x430 recommended)
└── assets/         # Game assets (images, sounds, etc.)
    ├── images/
    └── sounds/
```

### Back Navigation
Include a back button in your games to return to the hub:

```html
<a href="../../index.html" class="back-button">← Back to Hub</a>
```

### Responsive Design
Ensure your games work on all devices:
- Use responsive CSS units (%, vh, vw, rem)
- Test on mobile devices
- Consider touch controls

## Browser Compatibility

- ✅ Chrome (recommended, especially on Chromebooks)
- ✅ Firefox
- ✅ Safari
- ✅ Edge
- ✅ Chromebook browsers (optimized)
- ⚠️ IE11 (limited support)

## Chromebook Optimizations

This hub has been specifically optimized for Chromebook performance:

- **Reduced GPU load**: Simplified animations and effects
